# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
Changing when a player has won or lost, and when the board is full to print true or false.

2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
Replace one of the players with several random functions so no one but the computer has control over the moves.

3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
One way could be to set a function so that the computer will possibly choose one of the spots next to the space chosen by the player either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
